# computer-vision-controls

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Control simple system functions with hand gestures. Additionally, display hand coordinates in a separate window (developed for a later project).</p>

<h2>Helpful Info</h2>
<p><b>It is recommended to use a Python Virtual Environment.</b></p>
<p>External Python modules: multiprocessing, cv2, mediapipe, pyglet, pyvolume.</p>
<p>Developed on Python 3.12.3.</p>
<p>Tested on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS</p>

<h2>Extension Ideas For Later</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Add more controls! Currently implemented mute/unmute function as a demo. Maybe something more dynamic?</li>
    <li>Improve the visualizer! The visualizer is 2D but there is no reason this can't be extended to 3D. Would look way cooler.</li>
    <li>Deploy in practical scenario. Remoteless TV controls is a good use case.</li>
</ul>
